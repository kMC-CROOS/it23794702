# Thanglish to Tamil Transliteration Automation

## Project Overview
This project automates the testing of a Thanglish to Tamil transliteration website using **Playwright**.

### Module Details
- **Module:** ITPM
- **Assignment:** Assignment 1 – Option 2
- **Tool Used:** Playwright
- **Website Tested:** https://tamil.changathi.com/

## Description
Each test validates the system by comparing:
- **Input (Thanglish)**
- **Expert Output (Expected Tamil Unicode)**
- **Actual Output (Generated by the system)**

### Pass/Fail Criteria
- **PASS:** Actual Output == Expert Output
- **FAIL:** Actual Output ≠ Expert Output

This ensures **accuracy-based validation**, not just character detection.

## Test Coverage

### ✔ Positive Functional Tests (24)
- Simple, compound, and complex sentences
- Past, present, and future tense
- Questions and commands
- Polite and informal usage
- Mixed English words
- Numbers, punctuation, and dates

### ✔ Negative Functional Tests (10)
- Joined words
- Slang-heavy inputs
- Long paragraphs
- Formatting and spacing issues

### ✔ UI Test (1)
- Real-time Tamil conversion while typing

## Automation Logic
- The website uses a **single textarea**
- Tamil conversion occurs during **typing events**
- `fill()` is unreliable, therefore `type()` is used
- Output is captured from the same textarea

### Base Automation Function
```js
async function typeAndConvert(page, text) {
  const inputBox = page.locator('textarea');
  await inputBox.click();
  await inputBox.type(text, { delay: 100 });
  await inputBox.press(' ');
  await inputBox.press('Backspace');
  await page.waitForTimeout(800);
  return await inputBox.inputValue();
}
```

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Test Execution

### Run All Tests
```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Run Tests in UI Mode
```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

### Run Tests in Debug Mode
```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

## Test Report

Playwright HTML report is generated automatically for every test run.

### Report Location
- Report folder: `playwright-report/`

### View Report
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Test Case Documentation
All test cases are documented with the following structure:
- **Test Case ID:** Unique identifier
- **Input:** Thanglish text
- **Expert Output:** Expected Tamil Unicode
- **Actual Output:** Generated by system
- **Result:** Pass / Fail
- **Category:** Grammar, Input Type, Length, Quality

## Running Individual Test Files

```bash
# Run only positive functional tests
npx playwright test positive-functional.spec.js

# Run only negative functional tests
npx playwright test negative-functional.spec.js

# Run only UI tests
npx playwright test ui.spec.js
```

## Notes
- Tests are executed sequentially for better control of the textarea state
- Each test clears the textarea before input to ensure clean state
- Delays are included to allow the system to process Tamil conversion
